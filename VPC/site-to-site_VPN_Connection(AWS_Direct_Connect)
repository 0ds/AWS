"AWS Direct Connect links an internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit
Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to an on-premises router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router.
Create virtual interfaces directly into the AWS cloud and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, bypassing Internet service providers in 
the network path"

Architecture:-
     Connection from Private Network to the AWS can be establiashed in two ways
     1. Internet Based Connection
     2. Direct Connection
     Chossing AWS Direct Connection over Internet based is imp. bocause This private connection can reduce network costs, 
     increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

MPLS:-                                                                              <<.../

>>> URL:- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching  <<<
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a routing technique in telecommunications 
networks that directs data from one node to the next based on short path labels 
rather than long network addresses, thus avoiding complex lookups in a routing 
table and speeding traffic flows.[1] The labels identify virtual links (paths) 
between distant nodes rather than endpoints. MPLS can encapsulate packets of various
network protocols, hence the "multiprotocol" reference on its name. MPLS supports a 
range of access technologies, including T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL.

Network Protocols:-
-------------------
A network protocol is a set of established rules that dictates how to format, transmit and receive data so computer 
network devices -- from servers and routers to endpoints -- can communicate regardless of the differences in their 
underlying infrastructures, designs or standards.

You can use an AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection over a private virtual interface 
to one or more VPCs in your account that are located in the same or different Regions. You associate a Direct Connect 
gateway with the virtual private gateway for the VPC. Then, create a private virtual interface for your AWS Direct Connect
connection to the Direct Connect gateway. You can attach multiple private virtual interfaces to your Direct Connect gateway.
A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource. You can create the Direct Connect gateway in any public Region
and access it from all other public Regions.
